### What I learned

I learned to finish a project quick and easy in less than 30 minutes. Maybe it may a bit overwhelmed
to use webpack for such a small project, but I just copied and pasted from a previously solved channel.

This project may be too easy in relation to my skills. But I accidentally started it and did not want to have
an unfinished project on my dashboard. 


### Continued development

I think for now it's done.
